# Simple Image Transformation Neural Network

A lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to transform input images into stylized or enhanced outputs. This project serves as a starting point for tasks like style transfer, image enhancement, denoising, and other image-to-image transformations.

## Features

- Simple CNN architecture for fast image transformation
- Easy to train on custom datasets
- Built with PyTorch for flexibility and performance
- Supports CPU and GPU training

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- numpy
- Pillow (PIL)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy pillow
